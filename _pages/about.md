Hi! My name is Mare-Maria Park.

<span style="color: red">Under Construction!</span>


I'm a linguist specializing in French linguistics and translation. I hold a Bachelor's in French Language and Literature from Ewha Womans University and am pursuing my Master's at Seoul National University. My work spans tutoring, translation, and research, including AI translation and cultural projects like co-authoring a section on Korean art for Voyage en Asie-Pacifique.

Feel free to explore my work or reach out for collaboration!
